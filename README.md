I created a laser defender top-down shooter game in Unity as a personal project. Although the game may not have extensive features, it holds a special place as my very first venture into 2D game development. Developing this game was an enjoyable experience that allowed me to learn and improve my programming skills along the way. I plan to enhance the health system by incorporating a visually appealing heart image, adding to the overall user experience. I'm proud of this project as it represents my dedication, growth, and passion as a game developer.

Hope you Like this, as it's my first ever game made in unity.
