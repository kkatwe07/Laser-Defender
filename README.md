I made this game from scratch in unity when I had just started to learn 2D Game Development.
There's not much exciting in this game however I had so much fun to develop this game and I learnt alot along the way.
I am hoping to add a heart image for health system, the current health system is of numbers.

Hope you Like this, as it's my first ever game made in unity.
